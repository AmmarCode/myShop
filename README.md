# Distinctiveness and Complexity

- MyBoxingShop is an online retail store
- MyBoxingShop have two UI one for the shop admin and one for the customers
- Customers are required to create a profile to complete the purchase of their favourite boxing gear
- Customers are able to complete their payment using the integrated PayPal payment buttons
- Customers are able to view their orders history and it's shipping status
- Customers are able to rate their gear and write reviews about it
- MyBoxingShop is created with separate Backend and Frontend to allow more effecient scalability and upgrades
- MyBoxingShop utilizes Django-rest-framework on the backend and React.js on the frontend

# How to run 
## Frontend
### Installing Dependencies
### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```
The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file. 

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

## Backend
### Installing Dependencies

### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

### Virtual Enviornment

It's recommend to work within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then to start running the backend server run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
